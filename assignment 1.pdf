To automate the login process of a sample web application using Python and Selenium, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Install Python and Selenium:
   If you haven't already, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You'll also need to install the Selenium library using pip:

   ```
   pip install selenium
   ```

2. Download and configure the WebDriver:
   You'll need to download the appropriate WebDriver for the web browser you intend to use. For example, if you're using Chrome, download the ChromeDriver. Make sure the WebDriver executable is in your system's PATH.

3. Write the automated test script:

```python
# Import necessary modules
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC

# Define the URL of the web application
url = "https://example.com"  # Replace with the actual URL

# Create a WebDriver instance (in this case, for Chrome)
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# Navigate to the login page
driver.get(url)

# Locate the username and password fields and enter login credentials
username_field = driver.find_element(By.ID, "username")  # Replace with actual element locator
password_field = driver.find_element(By.ID, "password")  # Replace with actual element locator

username_field.send_keys("your_username")
password_field.send_keys("your_password")

# Submit the login form
login_button = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//button[@type='submit']")  # Replace with actual element locator
login_button.click()

# Wait for the login to complete (you may need to customize the wait conditions)
wait = WebDriverWait(driver, 10)
element = wait.until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, "dashboard")))  # Replace with an element on the dashboard page

# Assertions to verify successful login (customize as needed)
assert "Dashboard" in driver.title
assert "Welcome" in element.text

# Close the browser
driver.quit()
```

Make sure to replace the placeholders with actual values like the URL and element locators for the username, password, and login button. You may also need to adjust the wait conditions and assertions to match your specific web application.

4. Run the script:
   Save the script to a `.py` file and execute it using Python:

   ```
   python login_test.py
   ```

This script uses Selenium to automate the login process, navigates to the login page, enters credentials, submits the form, and verifies a successful login. You can customize it further to match the specific web application you are testing.
